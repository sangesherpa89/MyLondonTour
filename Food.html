		<p><i>My London Trip</i></p><p><font size="3"></p>
<p><b>Mildred's</b> - One of my favorite places! We stumbled in here the day we arrived, exhausted, not having slept in a VERY long time, but starving. This place delivered on delicious, cozy, healthy, casual, friendly dining. Love.</p>
<p><b>Wild Food Cafe</b> - This cafe was recommended by my friend.wild  This super friendly, artsy, cozy, healthy, new age-y, magical little spot is a gem. The salads are everything you dream of and the banana bread for dessert was literally the best banana bread I have ever tried. It tasted like a cinnamon roll. So yes, I will say it again, this spot is MAGICAL. Video about this cafe is posted below in this page.</p>
<p><b>Vanilla Black</b> - Sadly, we missed this spot. But this gourmet food vegetarian - vegan friendly - restaurant is on my list for next time.</p>
<p><b>Le Pain Quotidien</b> (Covent Garden or waterfront locations my faves) - Ahhh, my GO-TO spot here in the USA (LA, NYC, DC) - I was SO excited to try a UK Le Pain! And we went back again and again. Coffee, matcha, vegan soups and salads, tartines, chili and more. I love Le Pain so much.</p>
<p><b>Ethos</b> - Another one we missed, but I want to try next time.</p>
<p><b>26 Grains</b> - I was SO sad to miss this porridge haven, with vegan options. Next time!</p>
<p><b>Pont St</b> - The restaurant by Sophie Michell in the Thompson Belgraves Hotel. We went for breakfast and I had the BEST porridge I have ever tried. I love Sophie's healthy spin that she adds to her menus. Not all vegan, but vegan options for sure -- just ask your waiter if you have questions. Tons of juices, fruit, porridge and amazing non-dairy lattes for breakfast. Breakfast felt kinda fancy, but also very friendly and elegantly-casual.</p>
<p><b>Sea Containers</b> - Delicious food - not terribly vegan friendly at first glance -- but they pulled it off and I ended up eating my weight in those roasted EVOO carrots. And that was just a side dish!</p>
<p><b>Gail's (fruit + coffee)</b> - We popped in here for a light breakfast. I had a dreamy soy latte and a big fresh fruit salad. Tiny spot but loads of happy energy in there.</p>
<p><b>Sally Clarke</b> - Notting Hill (picnic food - juice and fruit and bread) - We popped in here for some snacks. I found grapefruit juice, fresh fruit and bread. Gourmet little store. In spring and summer this would make a great picnic- eats pickup spot before heading out to Kensington Gardens just a little stroll away. </p>
